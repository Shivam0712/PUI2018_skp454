Overall, the charts look great! Good job with the modelled data, looks like it tracks with the actual very closely. 

**CLARITY**
Some ideas for clarity as follows:
1. I'm not totally sure what removing the yearly and weekly trend is doing for each set of data. It might be worth clarifying this below. 
2. I think some of the titles could be reworded to make more explicit what each graph represents.
3. Same as above for labeling the lines. 

**ESTHETIC**
1. The lines might benefit from being different line weights or colors, it's a bit hard to distinguish between the orange and blue when they are closely overlapping.
2. I think, in terms of economy of space, you could remove the years from the month labels and just clarify that the data is for 2017-18 in the title of the chart. 

**HONESTY**
1. For chart 1, the "YEARLY_TREND" line doesn't seem to actually be showing a yearly trend, otherwise wouldn't it only have two differently sloped segments?
