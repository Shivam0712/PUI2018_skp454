#### Q: Assess wheather the location of the linkNYC access points is optimal to guarantee a more "democratic" access to the internet

1. Here, we make use of geopandas and spatial lag analysis.
2. Data obtained for linknyc sites and American census from american fact finder
3. Assessed wheather the location of the LinkNYC access points are placed where people have less access to broadband internet or not.

#### Help taken: Karan Saini - ks4703
1. Karan provided me the link to the remote location where he had uploaded the AFF published data for people with broadband access.
2. Initially I was reading the csv from my local directory and built my analysis on it.
3. Upon receiving the link from Karan I have changed the way I was reading the file and updated it to directly obtain the file from url.
