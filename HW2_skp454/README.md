## Part 2: Choose a file in CSV format from NYC Open Data and use pandas to read the file and mangle the data within it.

Imported data of 'drinking water quality distribution and monitoring' from NYC Open Data and made plot of Turbidity vs Residual Free chlorine.

First, data was imported by downloading csv file.

Second, data was importe in Json format and 2 more plots were made:
  1. Datewise Turbidity
  2. Datewise Residula Free Chlorine

## Part 3: Write scripts to stream real-time bus data from MTA through the MTA Bus Time interface. In order to access this data, you must first request an API key from MTA.

 1. In this task MTA BUS info API was used to fetch and output data about position of all the buses plying on a particular route.
 2. Along with position, the name and status of next stop of buses were saved in a .csv file.
