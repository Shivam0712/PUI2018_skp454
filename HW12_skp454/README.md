# HW12 : Clustering Time Series Patterns

## Assignment 1: Time Series in Subway Ridership
1. Find the periodicity in data using fourier transformation.
2. Cluster the time series based on 4 engineered features
3. Cluster the time series based on all the 194 timestamp datas

## Assignment 2: Time Series in Number of Business Establishment over years for NYC Zipcodes.
1. Collect data of business establishment in each NYC zipcode from the year 1994 to year 2014.
2. Run K-mean clustering on time series pattern
3. Run Gaussian mixture model clustering.
4. Run Agglomerative clustering.
5. Plot the results of these cluster on NYC map.
6. Compare clustering algorithms results and draw inferences.
